# ADR Tone Guidelines for Cursor Rules

When writing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for cursor rules, follow these tone guidelines to ensure clarity and accessibility for other developers:

## Core Tone Principles

### 1. **Third-Person Perspective**
- Write from an objective, third-person perspective
- Avoid "we," "our," "us" - these ADRs will be consumed by other teams
- Use "the project," "the team," "developers," or "users" instead

### 2. **Clear and Direct Language**
- Use active voice and present tense
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Avoid jargon unless necessary, and define technical terms when used
- Write for developers who may not be familiar with the specific context

### 3. **Objective and Factual**
- Present decisions as facts, not opinions
- Include concrete reasoning and evidence
- Acknowledge trade-offs and limitations honestly
- Avoid marketing language or subjective claims

### 4. **Educational and Informative**
- Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- Provide enough context for future developers to understand the reasoning
- Include relevant background information and constraints
- Reference external resources when appropriate

## Language Guidelines

### Do Use:
- "The project requires..."
- "Developers need to..."
- "This approach provides..."
- "The decision enables..."
- "The solution addresses..."

### Avoid:
- "We decided to..."
- "Our team chose..."
- "We believe this is..."
- "Our approach..."
- "We think..."

## Structure and Format

### Context Section:
- Describe the problem or situation objectively
- Include relevant constraints and requirements
- Explain why this decision matters

### Decision Section:
- State the decision clearly and definitively
- Use present tense: "The project will use..." not "The project decided to use..."
- Be specific about what was chosen and why

### Consequences Section:
- List both positive and negative outcomes
- Include immediate and long-term implications
- Mention any risks or limitations

## Examples

### Good:
"The project requires a standardized approach to cursor rule documentation to ensure consistency across development teams."

### Avoid:
"We decided to standardize our cursor rule documentation to make it easier for our team."

### Good:
"Developers implementing cursor rules should follow this pattern to maintain consistency and improve maintainability."

### Avoid:
"Our team should follow this pattern because we think it's better."

## Additional Considerations

- **Timelessness**: Write as if the decision is current and relevant
- **Accessibility**: Consider developers from different backgrounds and experience levels
- **Completeness**: Provide enough detail for someone to understand and potentially replicate the decision-making process
- **Neutrality**: Present alternatives fairly, even if they were rejected
